Notting Hill Carnival app
=========================

### about 

A basic mapping app to show soundsystems and transport 
status at the Notting Hill Carnival.

I'm trying to make this in a really simple way, using 
as much plain JavaScript as possible.



### stages

- render lots of markers

- on click of each marker: show info

- render sidebar menu

- on click of each menu item: show info

- add map tiles - only one zoom level

- on server: create json file with marker % positions from coordinates

- on server - make a call to TFL + output tube station statuses

- create map.moveTo function

- create more zoom levels

- search for marker



### for this I need:

- Easily update the dom			react

- A server	 					node

- Dev tools						gulp + browserify (+ a wee bit more)
